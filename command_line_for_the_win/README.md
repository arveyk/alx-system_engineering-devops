steps used in the SFTP-command line tool

First setting up an sftp connection. 
SFTP stands for secure File Transfer Protocol
It is prefered to FTP because of its security features

By default sftp uses the ssh protocol to
authenticate and establish a secure connection. Thus the same procedures are
available for sftp.
	  there has to be a Security Key and password for connection to the remote server.
	  Then open on the terminal the access to the remote server
	       sftp serve.account_name
