Some specifics about this infrastructure:

--Additional elements--
For every additional element, why you are adding it

--What are firewalls for
Firewall offer some level of security by restricting the access of resource (databases or computer) by external users who may be malcious or are simply not 
authorised

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
	It is the secure variant of HTTP. Information that is transmitted is 
	first encrypted and on reaching intended user it is decripted.
What monitoring is used for
	Monitoring is applied to check the functioning status of a system, If it
	is performing as expected, if there are any failures in the system..
	Monitoring also helps to check if there are any maliciouse attempts to 
	access the system

How the monitoring tool is collecting data
	It collects data by using application monitoring (where an application 		sends data and checks how fast it recieves and if there are any packets 	lost. etc) or
	server monitoring (where the server's behaviour like CPU usage and tempe	rature are observed)

__Issues with this infrastructure:__

Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
	It leave the system vulnerable since the layer of security SSL offered
	has been removed

Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
	Access by many people can overload it leading to slow or complete halt 
	of the server.
	Since the are no backups if it fails, all data is lost
	There is no fallback incase it requires maintenance
	An additional server thus is necessary to tackle these challenges

Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem

	If the server fails, a large part of the system is shut down leading to
	long down time
