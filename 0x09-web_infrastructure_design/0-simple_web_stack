	another programs/devices (the client)
What is the role of the domain name
	The domain name serves as an identifier of a device or service that 
	access the internet.
What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com

What is the role of the web server:
	A wb server receives request via HTTP or HTTPS and responds to them via		the same protocol. It can also store and retrieve resources if 
	configured to do so.

What is the role of the application server:
	An application server is a server that hosts applications or software
	that offer business logic(business application) through communication
	protocol (HTTP).
What is the role of the database
	A database saves data(information) in a systematic way that allows ease
	of access and retrieval to authorized persons.
What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
	The server uses HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTML files are sent
	and recieved via HTTP.

Issues with this infrastructure:
SPOF: there are multiple points of failure, The server, the application server, 	the webserver, if these are none-functional, the whole system is down

Downtime when maintenance needed:
	This will be the entire time the system is down, if the system is down		for 3days then there downtime is 3 days.

Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
	Since the capacity of the server is fixed and thus would not cope with
	a multiplication of services it would need to offer.
