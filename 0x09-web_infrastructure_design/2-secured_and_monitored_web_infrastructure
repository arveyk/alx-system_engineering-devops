__ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS__

What are firewalls for
Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
	This is the secure version of HTTP. Data, before being transmitted is 
	encrypted.
What monitoring is used for
	Monitoring help in checking if a system is working as expected and helps
	check if there are any suspicious activities.
How the monitoring tool is collecting data
	By checking the CPU and space and network health
	It gathers data from all application components
Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
	This can be done by calculating average the number of requests a 
	server receives	per second and
__ISSUES WITH INFRASTRUCTURE:

Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
	Terminating SSL mean data is left unencrypted thus not secure when 
	transmitted though a network.
Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
	Access by many people can overload it leading to slow or complete halt 
	of the server.
	Since the are no backups if it fails, all data is lost
	There is no fallback incase it requires maintenance
	An additional server thus is necessary to tackle these challenges
	
Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
	If the server fails, a large part of the system is shut down leading to
	complete system failure
