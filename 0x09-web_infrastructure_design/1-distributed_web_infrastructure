/* Some specifics about this infrastructure: */
__ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS__

For additional elements

__ Additional Server __ 
 Additional servers are help in reducing the work-load that would have been on
 one server and thus reduce chances of overloading and increase speed of work
 done.
 They also act as fallbacks. Incase one server fails, other servers step in to 
 take the workload of that server untill it can be up and running again

__LOAD BALANCER__
 The load-balancer is used to distribute workload among several servers.
 What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it 
  works: Round-robin, each request is sent to an individual server one at a time  	until all the server have received a request and the load-balancer start	s from the beginning distributing work(like a queue).
Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
	Active-Active setup: My loadbalancer enables this so as to take 
	advantage of having several working servers
	Active-active; in this scenario all the servers are operating
	Active-passive; the are active servers and there are passive servers on
	stand-by to take-over incase the active one's fail.

__Database__
How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
	The master database is the one that is written to and updated then the 
	changes are duplicated in the replica, thus the replica cannot make
	record changes and "push" to the primary.
What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
	Flow of changes made is only made from the primary to the replica
ISSIES WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE:
Where are SPOF:
	Single point of failure is any point in the infrastructure that upon
	failure can lead to seriouse drop or even complete halt of performance

Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS):
	This means that data transfer is vulnerable to being intercepted by 
	un-authorized persons or malicious attacks. Since there is no 
	encryption data transmitted is in plain text format and thus sensitive
	info can be easly stollen
No monitoring:
	Since there is no monitoring, it would be difficult to know 
		@sources offailure should one occur
		@if there are suspicious activities such as unauthorized access
		to the database...
		@ How the system is performing(is it as expected)
