Elizabeth it is in vain you say
Love not"-thou sayest it in such a sweet way:
In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
Zantippes's talents had enforced so well:
Ah! If that language from thy hear arise,
Breath it less gently forth-and vail thine eyes.
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried
To cure his love-was cured of all beside-
His follie-pride-and passion-for he died.
